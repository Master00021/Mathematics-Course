# And Place values and Estimating

Thousand years ago, we realized that numbers can get very big too fast. And we just could not create a symbol for every number that exists, so we created systems for counting. A series of symbols that represents a number by itself, but combining them in certain places, we were able to write larger and easy numbers to remember. (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)


## Place values

This concept allowed to us to give a certain value to a number, by the place were it is between numbers. For example, the value of 1**2**1 it's two tens, the value of **1**21 it's one hundred, and go on.

Every time the number arrives to nine, it becomes a zero, while the left number increases by one. 
This process can be infinite.
###### $$ 1 $$
###### $$10$$
###### $$ 100 $$
##### $$1000$$$$10000$$
#### $$100000$$
### $$1000000$$
## $$10000000$$
# $$Infinity$$
This system allow us to represent any numbers that exists, using only ten digits, or _symbols_.

## Estimates

**Place values** give us the capacity to make estimates. Estimates are a kind of measurement.

How many people are at the party?
We can just count by groups of tens, and then we will have a certain estimate.
We can say there are more than fifty, but not more than two-hundred.
So we estimate there are $100$ people.
The $1$ it's quite certain, while the $00$ are quite uncertain.

For example, we don't know how long we have been waiting, but we know that it has been more than five minutes, and we know it hasn't been more than fifteen minutes.  So, we could estimate that we have been waiting for $10$ minutes. The $1$ it's quite certain, but the $0$ it's quite uncertain.


**Numbers can be infinitely large, and infinitely small.**
