# And Notation and Operations

The decimals numbers, are another way to write the [[Fractions|improper fractions]] or the [[Fractions|mixed numbers]].

For example, the improper fraction $1\frac{1}{10}$, in decimal numbers it's $1.1$, the both of these expressions are equivalent.

Thanks to the **decimal point**, we can do this. Every number in the right of the _decimal point_, it's becomes a decimal number. $0.1$, the one, it's the **tenths place**.

Every time that a value its placed to the left of a number, it's becomes larger, and every time a value it's placed to the right of a number, it becomes smaller.

$5$ it's the thousands place.
$9$ it's the hundreds place.
$1$ it's the tens place.
$3$ it's the units place.
$2$ it's the tenths place.
$0$ it's the hundredths place.
$6$ it's the thousandths place.
_Etcetera..._

**Place values allow us to report the magnitude of something**.
The $1$ symbol does not change, what changes it's the place where it's placed, that's it what give the value of something.
