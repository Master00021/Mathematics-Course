Percentages strategy to convert it to a fraction.
$30\%$ it's $\frac{30}{100}$
30 out of a hundred means $30\%$.
$\frac{30}{100}$ it's becomes $\frac{3}{10}$, dividing the numerator and the denominator by $10$.
$30\%$ it's $0.3$, by moving the decimal point two times to the left.

To go to percentage from a fraction, we have to pass the fraction to a decimal first.
$\frac{3}{10}$ in decimals number it's $0.3$. If the question it's too difficult, you could find the $\frac{1}{x}$ value.
Let's say $\frac{1}{20}$, the value is $0.05$. So, $\frac{14}{20}$ is $0.7$.

Table with common fractions in arithmetic's.

|FracciÃ³n|Decimal|Porcentaje|
|---|---|---|
|1/2|0.5|50%|
|1/3|0.333|33.3%|
|1/4|0.25|25%|
|1/5|0.2|20%|
|1/6|0.167|16.7%|
|1/8|0.125|12.5%|
|1/9|0.111|11.1%|
|1/10|0.1|10%|

Fraction strategy equalize the denominator of itself to another fraction.\

Order the next values from the smaller to the larger:

#### 3. $45\%$ -> $0.45$ -> $\frac{45}{100}$
#### 1. $\frac{21}{50}$ -> $\frac{21*2}{50*2}$ -> $\frac{42}{100}$
#### 2. $0.43$ -> $\frac{43}{100}$
