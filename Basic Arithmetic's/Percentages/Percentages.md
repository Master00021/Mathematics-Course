Percentages are used among the modern world, discounts, tips, tests, etcetera.

**cent** comes from centum, and it's means one hundred.
**per** means out of.

So, percentages, basically means **out of a hundred**.

Percentages was created to become a convenient way to compare different magnitudes to one hundred. If you get 90% in some test, you could have get $9/10$, $18/20$, $450/500$, etcetera.

Percentages are **ratios**. There are specific comparations with one hundred. This number it's used because it's small enough to comprehend it's magnitude, and larger enough to give meaningful comparisons.

Percentages are fractions. $$ 80\% = \frac{80}{100} $$
$$ 80\% = \frac{80/20}{100/20} $$
$$ 80\% = \frac{4}{5} $$
We must be able to convert between **percentages**, **fractions** and **decimals**.
