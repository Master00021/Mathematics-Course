When a division have the dividend smaller than the divisor, it's called **fraction**, meaning that the quotient it's gonna have some value between one and zero, so, the quotient it's a piece of one, 
or a _fraction of one_. 

_[[Fractions, Visual Example|Pizza example]]_

1 it's going to represent the whole pizza. 
We can divide it in eight slices, meaning that the pizza it's equivalent to $1/8$.
So, we can say that you eat $6/8$ of the whole pizza.

In fractions, we can have **equivalent fractions**, these are the ones who are equivalent between them. $2/8$ it's the same than $1/4$. We can even manipulate the first one to obtain the simpler fraction. While we divide the numerator and the denominator with the same number, 
it's gonna be correct, following the Universal Laws. 
#### $$ \frac{2/2}{8/2} = \frac{1}{4}$$
### Comparing the Size of Fractions

If fractions have the same **denominator**, the bigger one it's the one with a bigger number 
in the numerator.
#### $$ \frac{3}{8} < \frac{5}{8}  $$
If the fractions have different **denominators**, you must use [[Comparing Fraction Sizes, Visual Example|another strategy]] to compare them.
#### $$ \frac{3}{8} ?\frac{3}{10} $$
We can draw them to see which is getting more space of the circle.
We can transfer them to a decimal notation.
We can find the **least common denominator**.

### Fractions with bigger numerator than the denominator
#### $$ \frac{4}{3} $$
The types fo fractions, like the above one, are called **improper fractions**. 
We can leave them like their are, or we can convert them into a _mixed numbers_, like $1\frac{1}{3}$. 
The _mixed numbers_ can be useful in too many context, for example, ordering pizza.

Let's say the restaurant divides their pizzas into 8 slices each one.
And your ten friends want 3 slices each one of them.
That's means that you will need a total of $3*10$ slices, so you are gonna need $30/8$ pizzas.
So, you are gonna need $3\frac{6}{8}$ pizzas. But you are not gonna tell to the worker that, 
your are gonna say, i want $4$ pizzas.

Let's say we ate $4\frac{3}{8}$ pizzas, how many slices did we eat?
We ate $4 * 8 + 3$ slices of pizzas, meaning $35$ slices of pizza.

**The denominator of the fraction represents the magnitude of itself.**
