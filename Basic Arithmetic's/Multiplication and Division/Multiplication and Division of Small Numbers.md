## Multiplication

This can be explained like an **abbreviated form** of **repeated additions**. 
Basically, to avoid writing $2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2$, 
we can just write the times that number repeated. $2 * 10$.
#### _Example:_
### $2 * 5$

_We are adding two **times** five_
Times means multiplication.
So, we are representing $2+2+2+2+2$ in $2 * 5$.
In this case, $2$ and $5$ are called **factors**.
And the result $10$ is called **product**.

So, multiplications combines identical groups of numbers into a larger single number, 
called **product**.

### Multiplication it is commutative
#### $$ 2 * 5 = 5 * 2 $$
These equations are identical, they give us the same product result.

### Multiplication it is associative

#### $2 * 3 * 4 = 24$
#### 	$(2 * 3) * 4 = 24$
#### 		$6 * 4 = 24$
#### $2 * 3 * 4 = 24$
#### 	$2 * (3 * 4) = 24$
#### 		$2 * 12 = 24$

It does not matter the order we choose to multiply the factors, the product it is not gonna change.
## Division

This is the inverse operation of **multiplication**, it breaks a larger number into a group of smaller numbers of identical size, called **quotient**.

$15 / 5 = 3$
$15$ it's the **dividend**.
$5$ it's the **divisor**.
3 it's the **quotient**.

### Division it is not commutative
#### $$ 10/2 â‰  2/10 $$
These equations are not equal, they give us different quotients results.

### Division it is nos associative

#### $10 / 5 / 2$
#### 	$(10/5)/2$
#### 		$2/2 = 1$
#### $10/5/2$
#### 	$10/(5/2)$
#### 		$10/2.5 = 4$

It does matter the order we choose to divide the factors, because the quotients are gonna change.

This properties are not arbitrary, they are applied in the reality, we just observed the world and see that this was true in it.

While the divisor it's smaller than the dividend, the quotient will be an entire number.
If it's inverted, the quotient will be a decimal number.
