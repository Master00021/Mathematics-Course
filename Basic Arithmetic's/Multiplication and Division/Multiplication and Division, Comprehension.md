### Resolve the next exercises:

#### $$ 4 * 7 = 28 $$
#### $$ 24 / 8 = 3 $$
#### $$ 2 * 9 = 18 $$
#### $$ 18 / 3 = 6 $$

### Choose the correct option:

1. Multiplication (is/is not) commutative
	Multiplication it **is** commutative, meaning that the order of the factors does not alter the product.
2. Division (is/is not) commutative
	Division it **is not**, meaning that the order of the factors does alter the quotient.
3. Multiplication (is/is not) associative
	Multiplication it **is** associative, meaning that the order we choose to multiply does not alter the product.
4. Division (is/is not) associative
	Division it **is not** associative, meaning that the order we choose to divide does alter the quotient.
