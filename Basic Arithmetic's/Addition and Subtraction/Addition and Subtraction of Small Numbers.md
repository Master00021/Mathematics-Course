## Addition

This is the most basic arithmetic operation. It represents the combination of two or more numbers, generating a single, greater number. This number it's called **sum**.
_[[Add&Sub, Visual Examples|example:]]_
#### $$2 + 3 = 5$$
The example above it's an **equation**. In this case, $2 + 3$ its equivalent to $5$.
Because of that, it's an equation.
$5$ is the **sum** of this _additive operation_.

### Addition is commutative

This means that, the order of the numbers does not matter for the final result.
#### $2 + 3 = 5$
#### $3 + 2 = 5$

### Addition is associative

This means that does not matter the order you make the operations, it will be the same final result.
#### $2 + 3 + 4 = 9$ 
#### 	$(2 + 3) + 4 = 9$
#### 		$5 + 4 = 9$

#### $2 + 3 + 4 = 9$
#### 	$2 + (3 + 4) = 9$
#### 		$2 + 7 = 9$

## Subtraction

This is the inverted form of the _additive operation_. This arithmetic operation, finds the **difference**.
_[[Add&Sub, Visual Examples|example:]]_
$$5 - 1 = 4$$
$4$ it's the **difference** between $5$ and $1$.

### Subtraction is not commutative

This means that, the order of the numbers does matter for the final result.
#### $3 - 2 = 1$
#### $2 - 3 â‰  1$

### Subtraction is not associative

This means that does matter the order you make the operations for the final result.
#### $5 - 3 - 2$
#### 	$(5 - 3) - 2$
#### 		$2 - 2 = 0$

#### $5 - 3 - 2$
#### 	$5 - (3 - 2)$
#### 		$5 - 1 = 4$

The **order of the operations** and the **numbers properties** are very important in arithmetic's.
This is the way it is because it **applies to the real world**, like the physics of the **whole Universe**.
Every order and the property have a concrete meaning in reality.

Once i understand the concept **behind these laws**, them it will no longer **seem arbitrary**.
If i know the concepts, think about them will be easy and normal, because i will be able to make comparations to the real world with the arithmetical operations.
